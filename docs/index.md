## About me

I'm currenly working a data scientist & machine learning engineer in the tech industry. I also teach data science, python, machine learning and SQL to both beginner and advanced students. As a consultant and mentor, I guide junior data scientists on their journey.


I have a passion for writing blogs about latest developments in data science and machine learning, sharing insights from my current and past projects, and discussing my experiences in teaching and mentoring. Sharing knowledge is something I deeply enjoy!
